  # late-commands are run at the very end of the *installer*, before the first
  # reboot. However users are actually created by cloud-init after the first

  # actually exist.
  late-commands:
    # Add xen-guest-agent - this is impossible (!) on Ubuntu 24.04 using
    # the normal apt/packages autoinstall configuration, because (a) the
    # xen-guest-agent apt repository does not use the "components" field
    # (odd, but legal); (b) curtin's apt-config process hard requires
    # deb822 .sources to have a "Components:" key, and (c) even if we
    # try to configure it with a .list entry rather than .source entry
    # under "apt:", on Ubuntu 24 curtin force-converts "deb" lines to
    # deb822 format. I wasted days on this. Have to just do it the
    # old-fashioned way here.

  # User-data is passed to the "real" cloud-init, which runs after the first
  # reboot after the installer has finished. So you can run commands which
  # modify users here, such as added 'testuser' to a new group.
